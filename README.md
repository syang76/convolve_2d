# convolve_2d
Assessment: "convolve_raw_*.dat" (not attached, so create my own in the python code) have data arranged in 3 columns. 
1) Column 1 and 2 designate x and y coordinates respectively. 
2) Column 3 is the main data defined at the corresponding (x, y) points.
3) Compute the 2-d convolution of these data and provide visualization.
4) Use any programming language or library as necessary.
